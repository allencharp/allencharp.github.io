# What is JWT Tokens
First, take a look at this [JWT token tools](https://jwt.io/) <br>

Simple put, a JWT is a string with following format:
{% highlight python %}
header.payload.signature
{% endhighlight %}
![JWT Format]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/zap3.jpg)
#### Header Sample
{% highlight json %}
{
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "HS256"
}
{% endhighlight %}
type is off course JWT, and hashing algorithm is use **SHA256** to encode the string


The JWT signature would be represented by this  pseudocode:
{% highlight javascript%}
data = base64urlEncode( header ) + '.' + base64urlEncode( payload )
hashedData = hash( data, secret )
signature = base64urlEncode( hashedData )
{% endhighlight %}

# How does JWT protect data
Most important, JWT is not a way to **encrypt** the data, it is a way to prove the data is created from a authentic source, so <br>
the data can be easily decoded and read.
**JWT do not guarantee any security for sensitive data, Don't save the sensitive data in JWT**
